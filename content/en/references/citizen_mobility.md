overview: In an interdisciplinary team, a prototype process for citizen-centred planning and evaluation of mobility points (car sharing, bike sharing) was developed with the involvement of citizens. GOAT was used for a data-based investigation of mobility and supply needs in the Schwanthalerhöhe district of Munich, from which concrete mobility offers and other needs/wishes for the planning and establishment of citizen-centred mobility points were derived. GOAT supported the creation of visibility analyses, accessibility analyses for daily destinations and bikesharing stations, as well as the analysis of rental data for shared mobility offers.
