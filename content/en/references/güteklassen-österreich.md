overview: In cooperation with the Technical University of Vienna and KCW GmbH, the public transport quality classes were calculated for the entire country of Austria. The analyses provided by us serve as a basis to show which public transport quality is provided by municipalities and which by the federal states or the federal government. Thus, the station categorisation was calculated taking into account various scenarios and subsequently network-specific travel time isochrones were calculated by the Vienna University of Technology. The results were then blended with population data and presented at municipality level.
