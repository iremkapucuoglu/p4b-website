## Background

Best experts are users! Therefore, we have started an online survey to learn more about the needs and experiences of people who have tested GOAT. The survey will be online during the entire duration of the [mFund project](../../../../2020/01/07/mFund/) and will support us along the development path. This will ensure a successful and practice-oriented development that will result in a comprehensive and useful tool.

## Content

The main part of the survey consists of questions about the usefulness and usability of the features provided (e.g. which features were used and how satisfied the user was with the results). We are working hard to make the tool more intuitive and user-friendly. Besides improving the front-end, we have several ideas to make GOAT easier to use (e.g. providing video tutorials or personal training). The answers to the survey can help us to develop the most desired methods.

Furthermore, knowledge about the user backgrounds can guide us in advancing GOAT in the most useful direction. Therefore, it would be very interesting to us to learn, in which field you would like to apply GOAT. At the end of the survey, the participants will be able to rate GOAT and name features that they would like to see implemented in GOAT in the future.
