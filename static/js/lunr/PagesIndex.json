basis.","content":" Development Process Geo Open Accessibility Tool GOAT is by far not where we would like it to be Apart from the ongoing professionalization which is seen as crucial to provide a truly useful and stable accessibility instrument additional features will be implemented on a regular basis The main objective we have been focusing on in the past months was making the interactive network modification and the setup process better Little time was spent for coming up with new features However there are some new envisioned and cuttingedge features which will bring GOAT to the status where the first version GOAT 10 will be released Future Prospects So far GOAT is still very much a personal project as funding for this first stable release has not been secured yet Consequently the date for the first groundbreaking release of GOAT for production purposes remains undefined Our current estimated time is between 1 and 2 years Nonetheless I feel its important to communicate the potential features that GOAT will have in future and further show which directions this instrument will take In the course of development some GOAT features will be added and others probably removed The following table gives a glimpse on the fields of development It has to be underlined that this list is not complete especially smaller features and features related to the user experience are not listed Feature Description Open tasks Routing performance The pgRouting library shines with its flexibility though this comes with the cost of relatively long query times for the calculation of the shortest path and the isochrones New features such as multiisochrones rely on more efficient calculations Although pgRouting is not tuned per default for highperformance with good network preparation and improved SQLqueries the performance can be boosted It will also be examined if database clusters or the calculation on multiple cores can improve the performance The work to improve the performance already started However with cycling as new mode and the implementation of new accessibility indicators this will be an ongoing challenge Calculation multiisochrones Currently the user has only the possibility to calculate one isochrone by clicking on the map A new feature shall allow for the calculation at several origins As origin certain amenities can be selected and the isochrones will be visualized all at once This could allow to answer questions like What is the share of residents having access to schools in 10 minutes walking This new feature goes hand in hand with the targeted performance boost of the pgRouting functions SQLfunctionality is also already partly finished only the implementation into the frontend was not started yet Modification POIs This feature can be considered as first step to allow users to model the effect of landuse changes It is targeted to develop an experimental feature that allows the user to draw modify and delete POIs As with the interactive network changes the user will be able to perform an accessibility analysis considering these landuse changes Interesting scenarios could be calculated like How does walking accessibility change if amenities are better distributed in space At the moment little interaction with POIs is possible therefore first some features eg POIs clustering have to be implemented that allow a more interactive and visually appealing way to interact with the POIs layer Individual routing profiles A better modelling of the individual component of accessibility is one of the core aims of GOAT There is especially seen the need to customize the routing functionality to better model the challenges mobilityimpaired people face on a daily basis Accordingly it should be possible to model accessibility also for the elderly and disabled people In addition the routing functionality will be refined to better model time losses at intersections inclines and other barriers Regarding the theoretical side there is already done significant effort eg excellent bachelor thesis at TUM Though further empiric findings need to be done to better understand how especially barriers influence the walking speed of different person groups New mode cycling Modelling cycling is one of the most demanded features However the challenge to have a realistic routing functionality has to be underlined It is targeted to model cycling for different user groups and conditions Groundwork in this aspect was done in a great study project at TUM The results from the latter will be further refined and integrated into the overall architecture Part of the backend functionality is already finished but the frontend and especially the integration into the interactive network modification functionality still require significant resources Nevertheless an experimental version of the feature will be released soon Dynamic recalculation heatmap The used heatmap builds on precalculated travel times While this is great for performance it comes with the cost that the calculation is not dynamic With the current architecture and resources a dynamic recalculation is not possible in an acceptable query time There have to be found ways to allow also a dynamic recalculation for this indicator A precondition for this feature is a significant performance boost of the routing functions After this has been achieved the heatmap functionality has to be further refined and adapted to allow scenario building Full landuse modification It is targeted to give the user the ability to fully manipulate landuse data Besides adding new POIs the user should be able to upload own building data allocate population and jobs and a lot more This feature is seen as an essential part to use GOAT as tool to help develop urban development plans The described feature requires significant effort as in the frontend and the backend extensive development have to be done In addition a very high user experience is the precondition for the feature To this end I am very open to ideas and suggestions from the community at large GOAT is an open source project and therefore targets a very strong interaction with its users Just get in touch The Data Issue Besides the listed improvements one main focus is on improved data fusion concepts and stronger engagement in the OpenStreetMap OSM community For those who have tested GOAT you might have realized that the demo app is currently only available for the city of Munich As much as GOAT can be installed by everybody on thier own server many still want to be able to use GOAT immediately Especially in their study area The reason for not extending coverage to other places is related to the claims I have on data quality and the resources available at my disposal for additional server space From my perspective as OSM data can be of varying quality crosschecks with local knowledge and other data source are essential when the data is used in a production environment To this date I can only be in a position to provide the services of GOAT within the boundaries of the city of Munich However in the coming months I can imagine to extend the onlineversion of GOAT to some other counties in the metropolitan regions of Munich I would also be very open to launch GOAT in other cities worldwide as an initiative to foster meaningful cooperation with others If you miss GOAT in your city and you are interested in becoming part of the community just get in touch and we could develop strategies to make this possible"},{"title":"Major extensions are

complete document can be downloaded below In order to create livable cities and shape a more sustainable mobility it is crucial to focus on walkable environments However the quality of the infrastructure depends highly on the individual For example onethird of the German population is temporarily mobility impaired and 28 of the population is over 60 years old which results in different requirements such as smooth surfaces and barrierfree footpaths To provide good walking accessibility all these different needs must be considered in the planning processes which makes providing appropriate infrastructure quite a complex challenge The four accessibility components Accessibility instruments as planning support systems can help to face these challenges Ideally all four components of accessibility landuse component transportation component temporal component individual component are included in an accessibility instrument This thesis examines how those four components can be included in GOAT To realize this the four accessibility component schema with the associated attributes was applied to GOAT as shown in the following figure Associated attributes of the accessibility components applied to GOATimagesblogadditionalwalkabilityanalysesfouraccessibilitycomponentswebp Four accessibility components adapted from Geurs and van Wee 2004 Data collection HasenberglLerchenau one of Munichss districts with the lowest average income with a size of 869 ha and 46953 inhabitants was chosen as the study area All necessary data was captured in OpenStreetMap OSM using the iOS app Go Map JOSM and Mapillary Although the OSMdata in the study area was mostly geometrically correct and features such as the street network and buildings were almost completely mapped for this study essential attributes were missing For example only 5 of all paths had information on illuminance and only 3 of the roads had information on sidewalk availability After 20 days of onsite mapping and offsite data preparation all 2000 existing paths with a total length of over 200 km were recorded in OSM Including information on road type width surface incline sidewalk availability illumination and wheelchair accessibility Likewise wheelchair accessibility was recorded for all POIs Therewith data quality could be highly improved see chapter 63 of this thesis Two buildings by the water in HasenberglLerchenauimagesblogadditionalwalkabilityanalysessceneryhasenberglwebp HasenberglLerchenau Individual and temporal analyzes With the improved data new options could be provided in GOAT To represent the individual and the temporal component three new routing profiles elderly wheelchair safenight that influence the route choice and walking speed were implemented The wheelchair routing only considers barrierfree paths and destinations while the safenight routing only makes use of paths that are illuminated at night Furthermore the opening hours of POIs were included to allow for timebased accessibility analysis more detailed information can be found in chapter 7 The analysis of the gathered data manifests that there is a high share of unlit and nonbarrierfree ways in the study area that do serve as important links for pedestrians The following figure shows a comparison in accessibility between standard and safenight routing from a starting point within a residential area using a 7minutes walking isochrone The contraction of the isochrone indicates that accessibility is significantly reduced if this temporal component is considered Walking accessibility using standard and safenight routing comparedimagesblogadditionalwalkabilityanalysescomparisonwalkingaccessibilitywebp Comparison walking accessibility Similar results are obtained for the barrierfree routing In addition it was found that many POIs are not accessible at all to persons with mobility impairments usually because of steps at the entrance By calculating multiisochrones wheelchair accessibility of important amenities for example of doctors can be evaluated The following video shows the comparison of the standard 10minutes walking catchment area around all doctors and the same area using the wheelchair routing profile The results are that approximately 8880 persons out of a total population of 46950 do not have barrierfree access to a doctor within a 10minute walking distance More analyses are provided in chapter 9 of the thesis Visualization of walkability criteria Furthermore the frontend was adjusted to include new layers on different walkability criteria illumination wheelchair usability footpath width surface number of lanes maximum speed parking street crossings and street furniture which visualizes the transportation component more realistically see chapter 8 These layers provide the user with useful information and allow to easily identify weak points in the footpath network As the objectively measured street level quality criteria cannot cover the entire concept of walkability also selfreported statements by pedestrians about their perceived walking quality were included to provide a more comprehensive picture This turned out to be particularly valuable as the perceived quality often differs from the objectively measured quality Conclusion With the realized changes all four accessibility components could be incorporated in GOAT These improvements provide useful insights into how different groups of people are influenced in their walking accessibility by changes in the temporal and individual components Therewith GOAT was enhanced to provide more holistic accessibility analyses But these analysis options depend heavily on data availability Therefore not all new features are by default integrated in GOAT Depending on the local context the features can be enabled or disabled This implementation should be seen as first attempt to better model the temporal and individual component of accessibility for pedestrians but further improvements will be realized in the future We are also very open to your feedback Furthermore the complete Thesis can be downloaded

the bicycle settings for recording and different features of the app Especially the high battery consumption and the high memory requirements for storing all images were challenging The best setup proved to be a GoPro for the pictures connected to a mobile phone for recording the GPS track and orientation northsouth additionally equipped with a power bank Bicycle with GoPro in a

210 km in 8 days Compared to the estimated working time in the planning stage 5 days for 240 km the actual working time was around 230 hours per day limited through the duration of the battery and the average cycling speed was about 10 kmh because it is necessary to cross the same streets several times There are very few areas and footpaths remaining but most of the streets are now covered To face the lower picture rate we organized a group day where 4 members from the GOAT community went together to take pictures of nearby villages Joint Capturing To organize this task Mapillary has a feature called Capture projects With this feature the user defines the general area that he wants to cover as a shape in our case Frstenfeldbruck Then the shape is divided into subareas each of them is called a task and is assigned to the drivers that are members of the group Figure 3 Before going to the city everybody downloaded an app called Mapillary Driver where every driver can see to which area they are assigned and for which streets pictures are missing In that way it is very easy to complete all the tasks Area of Frstenfeldbruck devided by tasks and assigements in Mapillary

stuck in traffic or felt overwhelmed due to the crowd in public transport And have you ever wondered why you have to go through it daily You are probably living in a modern city where long distances make citizens use motorized vehicles and invest more time in traffic Living close to schools workplaces parks and other services would reduce your time spend on traffic make your trips more sustainable and give you more free time This planning framework is called the 15minute city and GOAT can be used to assess it The congestion in public and private transport is a major problem in modern cities With centralized services and workplaces the transport system tends to collapse due to the high demand during peak hours In critical cases even offpeak hours As a result citizens need to use more time to travel time that could be used for leisure to relax study or selfcare Moreover the typical planning paradigm points out that when the transport supply is improved it would also induce more trips therefore we would be back in congestion soon Moreover more infrastructure could also mean more traffic and hence more pollution A new planning framework is needed The 15minute city is a trending concept It is mainly based on the principles of neighborhood mobility and promotes highly integrated and inclusive spaces as well as mixedland use areas Carlos Moreno the concepts promoter defines the 15minute city as the city where in less than 15 minutes dwellers can access their essential living needs Moreno 2019 Moreover in a 15minute city all the residents are able to meet most of their needs within a short walk or bicycle ride from their homes C40 Cities 2020 The implementation of the 15minute city has many benefits like the reduction of travel time and the decreased use of motorized vehicles That means citizens will experience a better quality of life and the city will produce fewer emissions and therefore will be a more sustainable city Many cities have started working on their implementation of the 15minute cities Paris is planning to restrict cars nearby schools to make streets safer for kids and encourage local business It is also aiming to transform caroriented spaces like onstreet parking into interaction areas and cycling corridors On the other hand Portland is outlining to reach that 90 of residents can access all their essential daily nonwork needs by foot or bicycle in 2030 To reach this goal they have already developed walkability heatmaps which measure access to commercial services and amenities C40 Cities 2020 Finally Bogot is creating a new

portlandonlinehttpswwwportlandonlinecomportlandplanindexcfma288098c52256 Application of GOAT The implementation of a 15minute city requires a comprehensive analysis of the local active accessibility First walking activity is closely linked to proximity and therefore relies on the existence of short connections and the potential to reach a suitable amount and variety of destinations Land use mix Frank et al 2010 This type of assessment requires a detailed description of the pedestrian and cycle network Geraint et al 2015 and therefore a careful evaluation based on robust GIS models and a humungous amount of data In this context GOAT has outstanding potential as a tool for planning 15minute cities GOAT uses OSM data one of the most extensive open geographical databases paired with diverse public data On the other hand GOAT operates with routing algorithms to calculate the potential of reached areas and compute the total amount of amenities within specified walking or cycling times Finally it is also possible to assess scenarios based on infrastructure changes points of interest and residential developments Next some examples of the use of GOAT in different implementations are presented Guarantee access to schools In this example figure 2 GOAT shows in red color the areas where the population density is high but the access to schools is low making residents travel more time to reach their respective education facilities The construction of new schools in these areas would increase the accessibility and enhance the nonmotorized trips to school in these areas GOAT Map

schools GOAT map with scenario analysis for new schoolsimagesblog15minutecityscenariowebp Scenario building with GOAT Figure 3 Scenario analysis for new schools Number and variety of amenities GOAT can also calculate the total number of amenities per type within a specific walking point This type of analysis would be advantageous when you are planning to move and want to make sure you have

contained a workshop with 56 local practitioners from the fields of transport and urban planning GOAT is meant to be a useful tool for urban planners and decisionmakers Therefore the best way to make it as practiceoriented as possible is to involve experts in the development process In the three test cycles the participants on the one hand got to know the tool and gained practical experience with it On the other hand they provided valuable feedback and made constructive suggestions on possible improvements The tool was improved after each test cycle so the participants tested a new and enhanced version of the tool each time Project timeline with dates and pictures of the workshopsimagesblogrelease10timelinewebp Timeline Figure 1 Project timeline We had three municipalities as project partners Munich Frstenfeldbruck and Freising After the test cycles the GOAT team organized several planning workshops with 610 participants in all three partner cities Other than during the first test cycles of our prototype with practitioners from Frstenfeldbruck the focus of these more extensive workshops laid on the suitability of the tool to be used in reallife planning tasks and the participants got to work with the already enhanced tool After the participants were familiarized with the tool and its main features they worked on planning questions Those questions were actual planning tasks from their municipalities Every workshop ended with feedback on how to improve GOAT and suggestions of new features Some of the suggested features are already implemented others will be implemented wherever possible The planning workshops were followed by a final synthesis workshop where the experiences from all three municipalities were brought together This workshop was used to evaluate the project and to define future development strategies for GOAT In total there were organized more than 10 workshops Some of them inperson some were held online due to the COVID19 situation We received positive feedback on the usability and usefulness of GOAT Moreover the tool is already in use by the local practitioners which also outlines the practicability of the tool Nonetheless we are not done yet Keep in mind that we received more requests about further features eg provision of a user login better tutorials scenarios with changed path attributes including the subjective walkability spatial extension to whole Germany which we will tackle in the future Networking Activities In addition to the development work we were active in different networks To disseminate our developed tool and get to know other persons that are working in this field we participated in many mFund events such as Fachaustausch Fuverkehr and Fachaustausch Radverkehr We are still in close contact and exchange with some of the people we met at these inspiring events Furthermore we were part of the interview series 7 Fragen an httpswwwwikorgfileadminmFUNDVFmFUNDWIK7FragenanGOATpdf where

MapillaryPluginhttpshelpmapillarycomhcenusarticles115001739989MapillaryJOSMplugin it is now possible to display the crosswalks and their location detected from the Mapillary images in JOSM In addition the street view feature helps to verify the physical attributes of the infrastructure and the accuracy of the position of objects eg traffic signs lane markings In the case of a crosswalk we are particularly interested in attributes such as freedomofbarriers and the type of crossing traffic light crosswalk refuge island etc This information can be derived from the images and accordingly the OSM tags of the existing infrastructure can be enriched Likewise missing objects in OSM can be identified and added after data validation Same signs in different identified in different locations by Mapillaryimagesbloghighdataqualitymapillaryfig1webp Mapillary locationsFigure 1 Two sequences identifying the same signs in different locations However sometimes different image sequences can identify the same traffic sign but locate it in completely different positions as shown in Figure 1 Here the blue sequence shows the signs located after the right turn coming from the northeast when in fact they are located before the turn In this case the green sequence located them in a more accurate position Despite the ongoing requirement for manual review the Plugin in JOSM simplified the evaluation of image data Mapillary API image segmentation and object detection Soon after trying the JOSM plugin another feature was released on 28 August 2020 Global access to map data with the Mapillary APIhttpsblogmapillarycomupdate20200828mapdatamapillaryapihtml It was the first step into the automation of data gathering The API provides 3 ways to access the image data and the information extracted therefrom 1 Images APIhttpswwwmapillarycomdeveloperapidocumentationimages returns the images from a defined area within a bound box or a point with a radius 2 Object detections APIhttpshelpmapillarycomhcenusarticles115000967191Objectdetections returns the segmentation per picture of the identified elements eg vegetation street houses 3 Map Features APIhttpswwwmapillarycomdeveloperapidocumentationmapfeatures returns locations of objects eg traffic lights bicycle stands traffic signs extracted from multiple images as point features on the map Segmentation of Maxvorstadt in Mapillaryimagesbloghighdataqualitymapillaryfig2webp MaxvorstadtFigure 2 Segmentation of Maxvorstadt using the Object Detection Algorithm from Mapillary One of our first uses of Mapillarys API was to create a map of Maxvorstadt Munich by using different segments from the Object Detections API In this case we looked for images showing cars the sky vegetation and sidewalks Since Mapillarys algorithm breaks the image into 65 classes of objects as shown in Figure 2 we extracted the images with the highest proportion of the classes of interest As shown on the map in Figure 2 it is also possible to identify streets with high vegetation or dense parking offer It is interesting to see how multiple streets have a high percentage of sky This may be due to wide streets and large open spaces such as around the Pinakothek or simply because most cameras were pointing to the sky Automation algorithm Regardless we decided to go even further We did not want to analyze only one neighborhood in Munich We wanted to capture the entire city or even extend to other cities where GOAT is currently in usereferences Our first challenge was to call the API for larger areas To overcome it we developed a function to divide the area into a grid of smaller squares The function also incorporates tiny time breaks in between the squares so we would not overload the servers Afterwards we joined the extracted information from all the squares into a single JSON file The second challenge was related to the parameter for the API Depending on the data required the API needs a different set of parameters that has to be changed manually To solve it we filtered our own library of objects from the complete list of the Mapillary API Documentationhttpswwwmapillarycomdeveloperapidocumentation This filtered library is within a YAML file which has all the parameters required for the API Now in a single run the script can call multiple objects either from the Object Detection API or the Map Features API You can find all our scripts developed for this purpose in our GitHub repohttpsgithubcomgoatcommunitymapillaryapi Making use of the data And how are we going to use this information For accessibility and walkability analysis Currently we have used the data from Mapillary to obtain a better data basis for the Walkability Indexposts20210406walkabilityindex and in this course we have collected more than 10000 images in the city of Freiburg But there are also many other potential applications Lets assume we are analyzing perceived walking accessibility in a neighborhood at night In this type of analysis we are interested in factors that influence the attractiveness of walking In this case that would be the lighting We can retrieve this information represented by the presence of streetlights through the Mapillary API improving the accuracy of the analyses Another use case could be the analysis of the parking capacity in a city With the object detection function it is possible to identify parking cars on the side of streets Sections of streets with an especially high proportion of parking space can thereby be pointed out and redesigned into more livable spaces"},{"title":"Innovation Contest by the City of

it with new features which are capable of displaying the current state of the walkability of the cities as well as potential improvements in a clear manner Walkability Index The digital webtool GOAT was already capable of displaying the availability of sidewalks Our involvement of the walkability index makes it now possible to calculate the attractiveness for pedestrians The idea for the development of WALKIE and the prototype came while participating in the MobiDataBW Hackathonhttpsvmbadenwuerttembergdedepolitikzukunftzukunftskonzeptedigitalemobilitaetmobidatabwhackathon in November 2020 Our team used the innovation phase March to June 2021 for further development of the index as well as for the consolidation of the new features of GOAT for the city of Freiburg Now WALKIE is a meaningful multicriteria walkability index which quantitatively displays walkability As a start the quality criteria for walkability and its evaluation were determined based on the preexisting scientific findings As a result the walkability index was developed and divided into six categories and 22 subcategories The walkability categories Walking comfort Protection from the road traffic Lighting subjective security Liveliness walking environment Vegetation waters Urban equipment The numerous individual indicators were rated in an algorithm evaluated and aggregated to a total walkability score These scores were calculated from 0 to 100 On this scale 0 symbolizes a low and 100 a high walkability For that we used various data sources crowdsourcing data as well as data from OpenData platforms of cities and states fe FreiGIShttpsgeoportalfreiburgdefreigis Furthermore we collected data from more than 10000 images of the streets of Freiburg by using the platform Mapillaryhttpswwwmapillarycom From this data we could gather information about the different attributes of streets or the existence of street lights park benches and more The usage of the Mapillary

pilot city Freiburg was crucial for the development of WALKIE and the successful project progress For this our team met up with the representatives of the unit DIGIT Digital IT of the city of Freiburg multiple times and implemented their feedback in the development of WALKIE Moreover the locally accessible data was implemented into GOAT and a special version of GOAT for the city Freiburg was developed In this version of GOAT the walkability index was published for the first time We were then able to display the walkability score per section of the path in Freiburg The green paths have a high score which means they are especially pedestrian friendly The orange paths have a lower walkability score and therefore could be optimized Thus weak points can be identified and easily visualized

information on the Walkability Index can be found hereendocswalkabilityindex Potential pedestrian flows The frequency of streets plays a crucial role in prioritizing improvement measures made by the local government For this purpose we developed an additional indicator that points out the potential pedestrian flows As an application example we would like to use potential pedestrian flows for school routes to elementary schools of Freiburg In this case the proportion of children between the age of 6 and 9 is known which allowed us to estimate the number of children in each residential building In the next step we calculated the shortest route from the buildings to the respective district elementary school and got the individual flows These were summed to determine the aggregated potential pedestrian flows The potential pedestrian flow is visualized by the thickness of the line which shows how many children potentially walk this path potential pedestrian flowsimagesblogwalkieppfswebp Screenshot of the implemented potential pedestrian flows in GOAT Image 3 Screenshot of the implemented potential pedestrian flows in GOAT Those two layers can be combined and show which paths have a high frequency and low walkability It gives a clear picture of which streets should be prioritized in urban planning The walkability for the route to school is an example and can be transferred to other relevant study areas and use cases We are confident about the usefulness of this indicator as the urban planners of the city of Freiburg tested the new features of GOAT and found it beneficial and effective GOAT will remain available for Freiburg for three more months after the end of the project What are our next steps The team is currently in contact with DIGIT

target for climate protection measures we are promoting lowemission forms of mobility to create more sustainable urban and rural areas Expanding and improving pedestrian and bicycle paths as well as providing key infrastructure can reduce CO emissions and contribute to a cleaner environment for the population Active mobility is therefore not only good for the body and mind but also helps the climate Another environmentally friendly form of mobility is public transport Here GOAT can be used to improve accessibility to public transport stops or to bike sharing stations For example it can be analyzed where a bus stop is still missing so that more people use the bus Sustainable responsibility As a company we have made a conscious decision to support sustainable development and make our contribution We are pleased to contribute to 5 of the development goals with GOAT In this context the SDGs serve as important guidelines to question our actions in terms of sustainability and to

housing shortages The discussion on public transit walking and cycling is growing louder with every coming year Landeshauptstadt Mnchen 2022 Wed propose the 15minute city as vision and inspiration to bring accessibility to the forefront for Munichs future Carlos Moreno coined the term in planning projects with the City of Paris which has taken his idea as a source of inspiration for a lot of rapid change in the city Moreno 2019 This shift is adhering to the transition from a monofunctional city to a polycentric city based on proximity diversity density and ubiquity to bind and offer greater quality to six essential urban functions living working supplying caring learning and enjoying Petzer 2021 The vision of the 15minute city is that all residents can reach basic needs and services within 15 minutes on foot or by bicycle and as a complement by public transport The challenge for a planner is to identify current service gaps and find suitable locations for new services and improved walking and cycling infrastructure As developers of the digital planning tool GOATgoat What is the planning software GOAT we are here for you SubCentralities Points of Interest POIs can be used as a great unit of measure for urban functional areas and urban vibrancy given mixeduse areas are not easily covered by general land use designation Yue et al 2017 POIs have no standard definition but are generally places or facilities where human activity occurs Chen et al 2019 That is restaurants hairdressers bakeries clothing stores pharmacies schools supermarkets bars gyms etc GOAT includes much of this data sourced from OpenStreetMap and others Urban vibrancy in our case can be the level of intensity of peoples concentration p 660 Yue et al 2017 Simply put where the people want to go Similarly urban functional areas can be determined by the distribution and interrelation of POIs Hu Han 2019 Identifying urban functional areas can help determine the starting point of construction as well as the process of development throughout the years Hu Han 2019 By looking at Munich through the lens of subcentralities a better analysis of the 15minute city is achievable Correa VergaraPerucich AguirreNunez 2020 Subcentralities in our case take the form of designated districts within Munich We chose the districts Giesing Neuperlach Sendling Schwabing and Moosach to compare

Schwabing is one of the densest residential areas of the city it also benefits from integrated mixeduse planning with bars restaurants and other shops at streetlevel access However Giesing has a higher population count but four times less amenities than Schwabing This poses a problem then as residents from one district will likely need to travel outside of their district to find desired and needed amenities Accessibility planning to new schoolsimagesblogmuc15mincityschoolswebp Accessibility tool for planning new schools Image 3 Screenshot of School Accessibility in Munich Accessibility

those managed by the municipality such as schools are very well distributed across the city Image 3 However other POIs such as bars and other recreational activities such as cinemas and museums are distributed primarily within the inner city Image 4 The issue of uneven POI distribution can mean a lack of diverse options and may result in more mobility outside of districts resulting in more cars on the road and more people demanding better transport infrastructure In order to achieve the 15minute city status a look at POI distribution throughout the city can assist us to target areas that could use improvements Is Munich 15minutecity ready In summary Munich has the potential to become a 15minute city Some districts are already readier than others The fact that nearby destinations in

ein wirklich ntzliches und stabiles Erreichbarkeitsinstrument ist werden in regelmigen Abstnden weitere Funktionen implementiert Das Hauptanliegen worauf wir uns in den vergangenen Monaten konzentriert haben war es die interaktive Netzwerkmodifikation und den Setup Prozess zu verbessern Dabei wurde bisher wenig Zeit investiert um neue Features zu implementieren Dennoch gibt es einige neue innovative Funktionen die bereits angedacht sind Diese werden GOAT zu dem Status verhelfen in dem die erste Version GOAT 10 verffentlicht wird Zukunftsaussichten GOAT ist bislang in jeder Hinsicht noch ein persnliches Projekt da die Finanzierung fr die erste Verffentlichung noch nicht gesichert ist Folglich bleibt noch undefiniert wann dieser bahnbrechende Release 10 stattfinden und GOAT somit vermarktet werden kann Wir schtzen dass dies in ein bis zwei Jahren umgesetzt wird Ich finde es dennoch wichtig die potenziellen knftigen Funktionen von GOAT zu kommunizieren und aufzuzeigen welche Wege dieses Instrument einschlagen wird Einige GOATFunktionen werden im Laufe der Entwicklung hinzukommen whrend andere womglich entfernt werden Die folgende Tabelle gewhrt einen Einblick in die Entwicklungsfelder Dabei muss betont werden dass sie nicht vollstndig ist und vor allem kleinere Funktionen sowie Funktionen die das Nutzererlebnis betreffen nicht aufgefhrt sind Funktion Beschreibung Offene Aufgaben RoutingPerformance Die pgRouting Bibliothek glnzt mit ihrer Flexibilitt wobei dies mit einer relativ langen Abfragezeit des krzesten Weges und der Isochronen einher geht Neue Funktionen wie MultiIsochronen sind aber auf effizientere Kalkulationen angewiesen Obwohl pgRouting nicht standardmig auf HighPerformance eingestellt ist kann die Performance gesteigert werden durch eine gute Netzwerkvorbereitung sowie verbesserte SQLAbfrage Es wird ebenfalls geprft ob DatenbankCluster oder die Berechnung auf unterschiedlichen Prozessorkernen die Performance steigern kann Die Arbeit zur Steigerung der Performance hat bereits begonnen Allerdings wird es mit dem neuen Modus fr Radfahrer und der Implementierung von neuen Zugnglichkeitsindikatoren eine fortwhrende Challenge bleiben Berechnung von MultiIsochronen Der Nutzer hat zurzeit lediglich die Mglichkeit eine einzige Isochrone zu berechnen indem er auf die Karte klickt Eine neue Funktion soll die gleichzeitige Berechnung von unterschiedlichen Ausgangspunkten aus ermglichen Als Startpunkt knnen bestimmte Einrichtungen ausgewhlt und die Isochronen alle gleichzeitig dargestellt werden Das knnte bestimmte Fragen beantworten wie wie hoch ist der Anteil der Anwohner die innerhalb von 10 Gehminuten eine Schule erreichen knnen Diese neue Funktion geht Hand in Hand mit der anvisierten Leistungssteigerung der pgRoutingFunktionen Die SQLFunktionalitt ist ebenfalls zum Teil bereits beendet Lediglich die Implementierung in das FrontEnd hat noch nicht begonnen Modifikation von POIs Diese Funktion kann als erster Schritt angesehen werden der es Nutzern erlaubt die Auswirkungen von Flchennutzungsnderungen zu modellieren Diese experimentelle Funktion soll es Nutzern ermglichen POIs zu zeichnen zu modifizieren oder zu lschen Durch die interaktive Netzwerkvernderung kann der Nutzer Erreichbarkeitsanalysen durchfhren und dabei die Flchennutzungsnderungen einflieen lassen Als interessantes Szenario knnten ua folgendes analysiert werden Wie verndert sich die fulufige Erreichbarkeit bei einer besseren rumlichen Verteilung der Einrichtungen Momentan ist nur wenig Interaktion mit den POIs mglich Daher mssen zunchst einige Funktionen bspw das Clustern von Zielen implementiert werden die eine interaktivere und visuell ansprechendere Art der Interaktion mit den Zielen erlauben Individuelle RoutingProfile ie Verbesserung der Modellierung der individuellen Erreichbarkeitskomponente ist eines der Hauptziele von GOAT Hier besteht die Notwendigkeit die RoutenFunktionalitt individuell anzupassen um die Schwierigkeiten die mobilittseingeschrnkte Menschen tglich haben besser abzubilden und somit die Barrierefreiheit einzubeziehen Zustzlich soll die RoutingFunktionalitt dahingehend verfeinert werden Zeitverlust bei Kreuzungen Steigungen oder andere Barrieren abzubilden Fr die theoretische Seite ist bereits eine signifikante Vorarbeit geleistet worden bspw im Rahmen einer exzellenten Bachelorarbeit an der TUM Wobei noch weitere empirische Erkenntnisse zur Beeinflussung der Gehgeschwindigkeit unterschiedlicher Personengruppen erlangt werden mssen besonders in Bezug auf die Beeinflussung durch Barrieren Neuer RoutingModus Radverkehr Die Modellierung fr den Fahrradverkehr ist eine der an den hufigsten gewnschten Funktionen Die Herausforderung hierbei ist es eine realistische RoutingFunktionalitt zu haben Das Ziel ist es Radfahren fr unterschiedliche Nutzergruppen und Bedingungen abzubilden Die Vorarbeit dazu wurde bereits im Rahmen eines sehr guten Studienprojekts an der TUM geleistet Dessen Ergebnisse werden weiter verfeinert und in die Gesamtarchitektur integriert Ein Teil der BackendFunktionalitt ist bereits vollendet aber das Frontend und vor allem die Integration in die interaktive NetzwerkModifikationsfunktionalitt erfordert noch weitere signifikante Ressourcen Dennoch wird eine experimentelle Version dieser Funktion bald verffentlicht werden Dynamische Neuberechnung der Heatmap Die verwendete Heatmap basiert auf vorberechneten Reisezeiten Das ist super fr die Performance geht allerdings auf Kosten der Berechnung die nicht dynamisch ist Mit der gegebenen Architektur und den vorhandenen Ressourcen ist eine dynamische Neuberechnung nicht in einer annehmbaren Rechenzeit mglich Es mssen Wege gefunden werden auch eine dynamische Neuberechnung fr diesen Indikator zu ermglichen Fr diese Funktion wird eine signifikante Leistungssteigerung der RoutingFunktionen vorausgesetzt Nachdem das erreicht wurde muss die HeatmapFunktionalitt weiter verfeinert und dahingehend angepasst werden dass die Abbildung von Szenarien ermglicht werden Komplette Flchennutzungsnderung Ziel dieser Funktion ist es den Nutzern die Mglichkeit zu geben die Flchennutzungsdaten komplett verndern zu knnen Der Nutzer soll nicht nur neue POIs hinzufgen knnen sondern in der Lage sein eigene Gebudedaten hochzuladen Einwohner und Jobs zuzuordnen und vieles mehr Diese Funktion wird als ein essenzieller Teil betrachtet um GOAT als Werkzeug zur Entwicklung von Stadtentwicklungsplnen zu verwenden Diese Funktion bentigt einen erheblichen Aufwand sowohl im Frontend als auch im Backend da dort umfangreiche Entwicklungen durchgefhrt werden mssen Die Voraussetzung fr dieses Feature ist auerdem eine sehr hohe Benutzerfreundlichkeit Ich bin sehr offen fr weitere Ideen oder Vorschlge aus der Community GOAT ist ein OpenSourceProjekt und zielt daher auf eine starke Interaktion mit den Nutzern ab Gerne einfach Kontakt aufnehmen Das Problem mit den Daten Zustzlich zu den aufgelisteten Verbesserungen ist ein Schwerpunkt auch auf Datenfusionskonzepte und ein strkeres Engagement in der OpenStreetMapCommunity OSM ausgerichtet Diejenigen die GOAT bereits getestet haben haben eventuell bereits bemerkt dass die DemoApp momentan nur fr die Stadt Mnchen erhltlich ist GOAT kann zwar von jedem auf seinem eigenen Server installiert werden viele wnschen sich aber GOAT sofort in ihrem Anwendungsbereich nutzen zu knnen Der Grund weshalb noch nicht weitere Orte abgedeckt werden sind die hohen Anforderungen an Datenqualitt und Ressourcen die ich fr zustzlichen Serverplatz bruchte OSMDaten knnen in ihrer Qualitt variieren daher ist es aus meiner Sicht unabdingbar Gegenkontrollen mit lokalem Wissen sowie anderen Datenquellen durchzufhren Vor allem wenn die Daten zu im realen Planungsbetrieb verwendet werden Bis zu diesem Tag bin ich bisher ausschlielich in der Lage GOAT fr die Stadt Mnchen anzubieten Ich kann mir aber vorstellen die OnlineVersion von GOAT fr weitere Kreise in der Metropolregion Mnchen auszuweiten Ich bin auch sehr offen dafr GOAT in anderen Stdten weltweit als Initiative zur Frderung von bedeutsamer Zusammenarbeit mit anderen zu etablieren Wenn Sie GOAT in Ihrer Stadt vermissen und daran interessiert sind Teil der Community zu werden kontaktieren Sie mich einfach und ich werden Strategien entwickeln um dies zu ermglichen"},{"title":"Große Erweiterungen bahnen sich

Interesse an weiteren Details kann das komplette Dokument unten heruntergeladen werden Um lebenswerte Stdte zu gestalten und eine nachhaltigere Mobilitt zu prgen ist es unabdingbar sich auf fulufig erreichbare Umgebungen zu konzentrieren Die wahrgenommene Qualitt der Infrastruktur ist allerdings stark vom Einzelnen abhngig In Deutschland sind zum Beispiel ein Drittel der Bevlkerung temporr Mobilittseingeschrnkt und 28 der Bevlkerung ist ber 60 Jahre alt Dies fhrt zu individuellen Bedrfnissen wie beispielsweise ebene Bodenoberflchen und barrierefreie Gehwege Um eine gute fulufige Erreichbarkeit zu gewhrleisten mssen all diese individuellen Bedrfnisse im Planungsprozess einbezogen werden Das macht die Bereitstellung einer geeigneten Infrastruktur zu einer recht komplexen Herausforderung Die vier Erreichbarkeitskomponenten Erreichbarkeitsinstrumente knnen als Planungshilfen dienen und dabei helfen diese Herausforderungen anzugehen Idealerweise werden alle vier Komponenten der Erreichbarkeit Flchennutzungskomponente Transportkomponente Zeitkomponente individuelle Komponente in einem einzigen Erreichbarkeitsinstrument dargestellt Diese Arbeit untersucht wie diese vier Komponenten in GOAT einbezogen werden knnen Um das zu realisieren wurde das Schema der vier Erreichbarkeitskomponenten mit den zugehrigen Attributen wie im folgenden Schaubild dargestellt in GOAT angewandt Attribute der Erreichbarkeitskomponenten verwendet in GOATimagesblogadditionalwalkabilityanalysesfouraccessibilitycomponentswebp Vier Erreichbarkeitskomponente adaptiert von Geurs und van Wee 2004 Datenerhebung Als Untersuchungsbereich wurde HasenberglLerchenau eines der Stadteile mit dem niedrigsten Durchschnittseinkommen Mnchens mit einer Gre von 869ha und einer Population von 46953 ausgewhlt Alle notwendigen Daten wurden in OpenStreetMap OSM mittels der iOS App Go Map JOSM und Mapillary erfasst Obwohl die OSMDaten im Untersuchungsbereich berwiegend geometrisch korrekt waren und Objekte wie das Straennetzwerk und die Gebude beinahe vollstndig abgebildet waren fehlten wesentliche Attribute fr diese Studie Beispielsweise gab es nur bei 5 aller Wege Informationen ber die Beleuchtung und bei nur 3 der Wege ber gab es Informationen ber die Gehwegverfgbarkeit In 20 Tagen Datenerhebung vor Ort und anschlieender Datenaufbereitung wurden alle 2000 vorhandenen Wege mit einer Gesamtlnge von ber 200km in OSM erfasst Einschlielich Informationen ber die Straenart Belag Steigung Gehwegverfgbarkeit Wegebreite Beleuchtung und Barrierefreiheit Genauso wurde die Zugnglichkeit fr Rollstuhlfahrer fr alle POIs erfasst Dadurch konnte die Datenqualitt insgesamt stark verbessert werden Siehe Kapitel 63 der Arbeit Zwei Hochhuser am Wasser in HasenberglLerchenauimagesblogadditionalwalkabilityanalysessceneryhasenberglwebp HasenberglLerchenau Individuelle und zeitliche Analysen Mit den verbesserten Daten konnten neue Features in GOAT implementiert werden Um die individuelle und die zeitliche Komponente zu reprsentieren wurden drei neue RoutingProfile Senior Rollstuhl sicheres NachtRouting hinzugefgt die einen Einfluss auf die Wahl der Route und auf die Gehgeschwindigkeit haben Die RollstuhlOption bercksichtigt nur barrierefreie Wege und Zielorte whrend das sicheres NachtRouting nur Wege whlt die nachts beleuchtet sind Auch die ffnungszeiten von POIs wurden in die Berechnungen einbezogen um eine zeitbasierte ErreichbarkeitsAnalyse zu ermglichen detaillierte Informationen dazu gibt es in Kapitel 7 Die Analyse der ermittelten Daten offenbart dass es im Untersuchungsgebiet eine hohe Anzahl von unbeleuchteten und nichtbarrierefreien Wegen gibt die als wichtige FuwegeVerbindungen gelten Die folgende Abbildung zeigt einen ErreichbarkeitsVergleich zwischen dem Standard und dem sicheren NachtRouting von einem Startpunkt innerhalb eines Wohngebietes unter Verwendung einer 7MinutenGehischochrone Die Verkleinerung der Isochrone zeigt auf dass die Erreichbarkeit unter Bercksichtigung dieser tageszeitlichen Komponente deutlich reduziert wird Erreichbarkeitsvergleich nach Tageszeit imagesblogadditionalwalkabilityanalysescomparisonwalkingaccessibilitywebp ErreichbarkeitsVergleich hnliche Ergebnisse erhlt man auch bei der barrierefreien Routingoption Auerdem wurde festgestellt dass viele POIs nicht fr Menschen mit Mobilittseinschrnkungen zugnglich sind Meistens liegt dies daran dass sich Stufen am Eingang befinden Durch die Berechnung der MultiIsochronen kann die RollstuhlErreichbarkeit wichtiger Einrichtungen wie beispielsweise von rztehusern berechnet werden Das folgende Video zeigt alle rzte die innerhalb eines 10GehminutenEinzugsbereich liegen wenn die StandartRoutingoption ausgewhlt wird und die selbe Analyse bei Auswahl des RollstuhlProfils im Vergleich Daraus ergibt sich dass ca 8880 Menschen von einer Gesamtbevlkerung von 46950 keinen barrierefreien Zugang zu rzten innerhalb eines 10mintigen Fuwegs haben Weitere Analysen finden sich im Kapitel 9 der Masterarbeit Visualiserung der Walkability Kriterien Auerdem wurde das Frontend angepasst um weitere Layer zu verschiedenen Kriterien zur fulufigen Erreichbarkeit zu visualisieren Beleuchtung Rollstuhltauglichkeit Gehwegbreite Oberflchenbeschaffenheit Anzahl der Fahrspuren Hchstgeschwindigkeit Parkmglichkeiten Straenkreuzungen Stadtmbel wodurch die Transportkomponente realistischer dargestellt wird Kapitel 8 Diese Layer liefern den Anwenderinnen ntzliche Informationen und ermglichen dadurch Schwachstellen im Fuwegnetzwerk leicht zu erkennen Die objektiv erhobenen Qualittskriterien der Straenebene knnen jedoch nicht das gesamte Konzept der fulufigen Erreichbarkeit abdecken daher wurden auch Aussagen von Passanten ber die wahrgenommene Qualitt der fulufigen Erreichbarkeit einbezogen um so ein umfassenderes Bild zu liefern Das stellte sich als besonders wertvoll heraus da die wahrgenommene Qualitt oft von der objektiv gemessenen Qualitt abweicht Fazit Mit den implementierten nderungen konnten alle vier ErreichbarkeitsKomponenten in GOAT integriert werden Diese Ergnzungen bieten spannende Einblicke wie die fulufige Erreichbarkeit von unterschiedlichen Nutzergruppen durch nderungen der zeitlichen und individuellen Komponente beeinflusst wird So wurde GOAT erweitert um eine ganzheitlichere Erreichbarkeitsanalyse zu ermglichen Da diese Analyseoptionen stark von der Datenverfgbarkeit abhngen sind nicht alle neuen Funktionen standardmig in GOAT integriert Die Funktionen knnen aber je nach lokalem Kontext aktiviert oder deaktiviert werden Diese Implementierung kann als erster Versuch zur besseren Modellierung der zeitlichen und individuellen Komponente der fulufigen Erreichbarkeit angesehen werden Weitere Ergnzungen und Verbesserungen werden in Zukunft folgen Wir sind sehr offen fr Feedback und freuen uns auf Ihre Anregungen Die komplette

aus unterschiedlichen Quellen gesucht OpenStreetMap war wie immer eine hilfreiche Informationsquelle dennoch haben viele Details gefehlt Deshalb haben wir uns Mapillaryhttpswwwmapillarycom zu Nutze gemacht Mapillary kann als das Google Street View der Open Source Community beschrieben werden Menschen aus aller Welt haben Bildmaterial von Millionen von Kilometern an stdtischen Straen Fugnger oder Fahrradwegen aufgenommen Von ihren Autos aus beim Fahrradfahren oder auch einfach im Zufugehen Das Ziel ist es eine aktuelle Quelle fr das Geschehen auf den Straen zu erhalten Das ist aber noch lngst nicht alles Das Besondere an Mapillary ist die KIbasierte Objekterkennung So knnen verschiedenste Objekte Verkehrsschilder Hydranten Fahrbahnmarkierungen Fahrradstnder etc automatisch auf den Bildern erkannt und so ihre rumliche Position auf der Karte ermittelt werden Mapillary in Frstenfeldbruck Da in Frstenfeldbruck lediglich ein kleiner Teil des Straennetzwerkes im Vorfeld bereits in Mapillary erfasst war haben wir uns dazu entschieden raus zu gehen und die Bilder selbst aufzunehmen Dieser Screenshot zeigt welchen Bereich wir bisher abgedeckt haben Die Abdeckung von Frstenfeldbruck in Mapillaryimagesblogmapillarymapillaryffbwebp Erfasste Wege in Frstenfeldbruck Abbildung 1 Das Gebiet in Frstenfeldbruck und die erfassten Wege Um zu lernen mit Mapillary zu arbeiten haben wir zunchst einige Tests in Mnchen durchgefhrt bevor wir nach Frstenfeldbruck gefahren sind Dabei haben wir unterschiedliche Kameras und Haltevorrichtungen zur Befestigung des Handys bzw der GoPro am Fahrrad sowie verschiedene Einstellungen fr die Aufnahme und unterschiedliche Funktionen der App ausprobiert Vor allem der hohe Batterieverbrauch und der hohe Speicherplatzbedarf fr die Bilder stellten sich als Herausforderungen dar Als bestes Setup erwies sich die GoPro fr die Bilder in Kombination mit einem Handy zur Aufnahme der GPSTracks und zur Orientierung Norden Sden sowie eine zustzliche Powerbank Fahrrad mit befestigter GoPro in einer SBahnimagesblogmapillarymapillarybikewebp Mit dem Fahrrad auf dem Weg nach Frstenfeldbruck Abbildung 2 Fahrrad mit GoPro in der SBahn aufgenommen auf dem Weg nach Frstenfeldbruck Bisher haben wir innerhalb dieses Gebietes 210 km in 8 Tagen erfasst Verglichen mit der in der Planungszeit geschtzten Arbeitszeit 5 Tage fr 240km war die tatschliche Arbeitszeit ca 230 Stunden pro Tag durch die Akkulaufzeit begrenzt und die durchschnittliche Geschwindigkeit beim Fahrradfahren lag bei ca 10kmh Der erhhte Zeitaufwand liegt ua daran dass es notwendig war einige Straenabschnitte mehrmals zu befahren um in alle Teile des Straennetzwerks zu gelangen Ein paar wenige Bereiche und Fugngerwege sind aktuell noch brig aber die meisten Straenabschnitte sind nun abgedeckt Um dieser geringen Bilderfassungsrate entgegen zu wirken haben wir uns an einem Tag mit vier Mitgliedern der GOATCommunity getroffen und die umliegenden Ortschaften fotografiert Gemeinschaftliche Erhebung Um diese Aufgabe zu organisieren haben wir bei Mapillary die Funktion Capture projects genutzt Mit dieser Funktion kann der Nutzende die Umrisse des Bereichs der erfasst werden soll definieren In unserem Fall Frstenfeldbruck Im Anschluss daran werden die Umrisse in Teilbereiche unterteilt die als tasks also als Aufgaben bezeichnet und den Drivern Mitgliedern der Gruppe zugeteilt Abbildung 3 Bevor wir in das Untersuchungsgebiet gefahren sind musste jedes Mitglied zunchst die App Mapillary Driver herunterladen Dort knnen alle Driver sehen welcher Teilbereich

Mit GOAT können entsprechende Analysen durchgeführt und die Umsetzung dieses Konzept vorangetrieben werden.","content":" Die 15MinutenStadt Standen Sie schon einmal im Stau oder fhlten sich durch die Menschenmenge in den ffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln berfordert Haben Sie sich jemals gefragt warum Sie das tglich durchmachen mssen Sie leben vermutlich in einer modernen Stadt wo groe Entfernungen dazu fhren dass Einwohner motorisierte Fahrzeuge nutzen und viel Zeit in die Fortbewegung investieren mssen Wenn Sie in der Nhe von Schulen Arbeitssttten Parks und anderen Dienstleistungen wohnen verbringen Sie weniger Zeit in Verkehrsmitteln gestalten ihre Wege insgesamt nachhaltiger und haben mehr Zeit fr Freizeit zur Verfgung Dieser Planungsrahmen wird als die 15MinutenStadt bezeichnet und GOAT kann dazu genutzt werden diesen zu erreichen Die berlastung des sowohl ffentlichen als auch privaten Verkehrs stellt ein groes Problem in modernen Stdten dar Bei zentralisierten Dienstleistungen und Arbeitssttten neigt das Verkehrssystem dazu an Stozeiten zu kollabieren In kritischen Fllen geschieht das sogar auerhalb der Hauptverkehrszeiten Als Folge mssen die Bewohnerinnen mehr Zeit fr Fahrten aufwenden Zeit die fr die Freizeit zum Entspannen oder Lernen genutzt werden knnte Auerdem weist das typische Planungsparadigma darauf hin dass eine Verbesserung des Verkehrsangebots zu einer hheren Nutzung und somit zu mehr Fahrten fhrt Daher wrde das folglich auch wieder zu mehr Verkehr mehr Staus und dadurch auch zu verstrkter Umweltverschmutzung fhren Ein neuer Planungsrahmen ist gefragt Die 15MinutenStadt ist ein Trendkonzept welches hauptschlich auf Prinzipien der Nachbarschaftsmobilitt basiert wo hoch integrierte und inklusive Rume sowie gemischte Landnutzungsflchen gefrdert werden Der Initiator des Konzepts Carolis Moreno definiert die 15MinutenStadt folgendermaen die Stadt in der Bewohnerinnen ihre Grundbedrfnisse in weniger als 15 Minuten befriedigen knnen Moreno 2019 Darber hinaus knnen alle Einwohner die meisten ihrer Besorgungen mit einem kurzen Fuweg oder einer Fahrradfahrt von ihrem Wohnort erledigen C40 Cities 2020 Die Implementierung der 15MinutenStadt hat viele Vorteile wie die Verkrzung der Fahrtzeit und die reduzierte Nutzung motorisierter Fahrzeuge Das bedeutet die Brger erfahren eine hhere Lebensqualitt weniger stdtische Emissionen werden verursacht und dadurch werden die Stdte insgesamt nachhaltiger Viele Stdte haben bereits angefangen an der Implementierung der 15MinutenStadt zu arbeiten Beispielsweise Paris plant den Autoverkehr in der Nhe von Schulen einzuschrnken um die Straen fr Kinder sicherer zu machen lokale Geschfte zu frdern und um Bereiche die fr Autos ausgerichtet sind wie etwa Parkpltze auf der Strae in Interaktionsbereiche und Fahrradkorridore umzuwandeln Darber hinaus hat es sich zB Portland zum Ziel gesetzt dass 90 aller Bewohner alle ihre wesentlichen tglichen nichtberuflichen Bedrfnisse bis 2030 zu Fu oder mit dem Fahrrad erreichen knnen Dazu hat die Stadt bereits Heatmaps fr die fulufige Erreichbarkeit entwickelt die den Zugang zu kommerziellen Dienstleitungen und Einrichtungen messen C40 Cities 2020 Bogot schafft auerdem einen neuen Planungsrahmen in dem Familien wesentliche Ziele wie Gesundheitseinrichtungen Dienstleistungen und Unterhaltung innerhalb von einem Fuweg von

20MinutenNachbarschaftsKonzept von Portland USA Quelle portlandonlinehttpswwwportlandonlinecomportlandplanindexcfma288098c52256 Einsatz von GOAT Die Umsetzung einer 15MinutenStadt erfordert eine umfassende Analyse der lokalen aktiven Erreichbarkeit Die Fugngeraktivitt ist eng verknpft mit der rumlichen Nhe und hngt daher von der Verfgbarkeit kurzer Verbindungswege ab sowie dem Potenzial eine entsprechende Anzahl und Vielfalt von Zielen zu erreichen Landnutzungsmix Frank et al 2010 Diese Art der Auswertung erfordert eine detaillierte Beschreibung des Fugnger und Fahrradwegnetzwerkes Geraint et al 2015 und somit eine sorgfltige Bewertung auf Grundlage robuster GISModelle und einer enormen Datenmenge GOAT hat in diesem Zusammenhang erhebliches Potenzial als Werkzeug fr die Planung von 15MinutenStdten GOAT nutzt OSMDaten eine der umfangreichsten offenen geographischen Datenbanken gepaart mit diversen ffentlichen Datenstzen Diese Daten speist GOAT in RoutingAlgorithmen ein um das Potenzial der erreichten Gebiete zu berechnen und die Gesamtmenge der Einrichtungen innerhalb der festgelegten Geh oder Fahrradzeiten zu ermitteln Es ist auerdem mglich Szenarien mit Infrastrukturvernderungen neuen POIs und Wohnentwicklungen zu bewerten Als nchstes werden einige Beispiele fr die Verwendung von GOAT in unterschiedlichen Anwendungen vorgestellt Erreichbarkeit zu Schulen garantieren GOAT zeigt in diesem Beispiel Abbildung 2 in roter Farbe die Gebiete in denen die Bevlkerungsdichte hoch jedoch die Erreichbarkeit von Schulen niedrig ist So mssen die Bewohnerinnen lnger fahren um ihre Bildungseinrichtung zu erreichen Der Bau neuer Schulen in diesen Gebieten wrde die Erreichbarkeit verbessern und dadurch die Anzahl der Schulwege die mit nichtmotorisierten Verkehrsmitteln dort zurck gelegt werden steigern GOATKarte mit dem Vergleich von Erreichbarkeit und Bevlkerungsdichte fr Schulenimagesblog15minutecityheatmapwebp Erreichbarkeit zu

ausreichender Detailgenauigkeit zur Verfgung Um die Datenlcken in OSM zu schlieen verwenden wir ua Mapillaryhttpswwwmapillarycom Mapillary ist eine Plattform ber die Bildsequenzen des Straenraums aufgenommen und mit der Community offen geteilt werden knnen Aus diesen Bildaufnahmen knnen auerdem zahlreiche Daten ausgelesen werden Anfang 2020 haben wir Frstenfeldbruck mit Mapillary kartiert20200425mapillary Wir verwenden die von uns und von anderen Nutzern erhobenen Bildsequenzen zur Verbesserung der Daten die fr unsere Analyse relevant sind Bis dato wurden die meisten Schritte Analyse der Bilder Objekterkennung Speichern der ausgelesenen Informationen etc manuell durchgefhrt Wir als regelmige MapillaryNutzer sind natrlich auch Leser des MapillaryBlogs Am 24 August 2020 wurde dort der Beitrag Mapillary map features now available globally in OpenStreetMaphttpsblogmapillarycomupdate20200824globalmapfeaturesopenstreetmaphtml verffentlicht Nachdem wir die Updates gelesen haben haben wir gleich die neuen Funktionen ausprobiert Mapillary Plugin fr JOSM Im Folgenden teilen wir unsere Erfahrungen mit der Kartierung und Aktualisierung der Fugngerberwege in Frstenfeldbruck Zuerst haben wir ber Overpass Turbohttpoverpassturboeu einen BasisLayer mit Fugngerberwegen abgerufen In diesem Layer sind alle derzeit in OSM eingetragenen Fugngerberquerungen abgebildet Die Idee war diese mit den Fugngerberwegen zu vergleichen die durch den MapillaryAlgorithmus identifiziert wurden Fr diese Analyse haben wir JOSMhttpsjosmopenstreetmapde verwendet JOSM ist ein erweiterbarer OSMEditor als Desktopanwendung mit dem Objekte und ihre Attribute einfach und effizient bearbeitet werden knnen ber das Mapillary Pluginhttpshelpmapillarycomhcenusarticles115001739989MapillaryJOSMplugin ist es mglich die aus den MapillaryAufnahmen erkannten Fugngerberwege und ihren Standort in JOSM einzublenden Die StreetViewFunktion hilft dabei die physischen Eigenschaften der Infrastruktur und die Genauigkeit der Position der Objekte zB Verkehrsschilder Fahrbahnmarkierungen zu berprfen Bei einem Fugngerberweg sind uns vor allem Attribute wie die Barrierefreiheit und die Art der berquerung Ampel Zebrastreifen Mittelinsel etc wichtig Diese Informationen knnen den Bildern entnommen und dementsprechend die OSMTags der vorhandenen Infrastruktur angereichert werden Ebenso knnen in OSM fehlende Objekte identifiziert und nach durchgefhrter Datenvalidierung hinzugefgt werden Dieselben Verkehrszeichen an unterschiedlichen Stellen geortetimagesbloghighdataqualitymapillaryfig1webp Zwei Sequenzen mit VerkehrszeichenAbbildung 1 Zwei Bildsequenzen die dasselbe Verkehrszeichen an zwei verschiedenen Stellen identifizieren Ein teilweise auftretendes Problem ist dass ein Verkehrszeichen oftmals von mehreren Bildsequenzen erkannt und jeweils an unterschiedlichen Positionen lokalisiert wird siehe Abbildung 1 Hier zeigt die blaue Sequenz dass sich die Schilder nach der Rechtskurve aus Nordosten kommend befinden in Wirklichkeit befinden sie sich aber vor der Kurve In diesem Fall hat die grne Sequenz sie an einer genaueren Position lokalisiert Trotz der noch notwendigen manuellen berprfung erleichterte das Plugin in JOSM die Auswertung der Bilddaten Mapillary API Bildsegmentierung und Objekterkennung Schon bald nach dem Ausprobieren des JOSM Plugins wurde am 28 August 2020 eine weitere Funktion verffentlicht Global access to map data with the Mapillary APIhttpsblogmapillarycomupdate20200828mapdatamapillaryapihtml Dies war der erste Schritt zur Automatisierung der Datenerfassung Die API bietet drei Moglichkeiten auf die Bilddaten und die daraus extrahierten Informationen zuzugreifen 1 Images APIhttpswwwmapillarycomdeveloperapidocumentationimages liefert alle Bilder innerhalb eines definierten Bereichs innerhalb einer Bounding Box oder eines Radius um einen Punkt 2 Object Detection APIhttpshelpmapillarycomhcenusarticles115000967191Objectdetections liefert pro Bild die Segmentierung der darauf zu erkennenden Elemente zB Vegetation Strae Huser 3 Map Features APIhttpswwwmapillarycomdeveloperapidocumentationmapfeatures liefert die aus mehreren Bildern extrahierte Position von Objekten zB Ampel Fahrradstnder Verkehrsschilder als PunktFeatures Segmentierung von Maxvorstadt in Mapillaryimagesbloghighdataqualitymapillaryfig2webp MaxvorstadtAbbildung 2 Segmentierung von Maxvorstadt ber den Object Detection Algorithmus von Mapillary Eine unserer ersten Anwendungen der MapillaryAPI war die Erstellung einer Karte von Maxvorstadt Mnchen unter Verwendung verschiedener Segmente aus der Object Detections API In diesem Fall haben wir nach Bildern auf denen Autos der Himmel Vegetation und Gehwege zu sehen waren gesucht Da der MapillaryAlgorithmus das Bild wie in Abbildung 2 dargestellt in 65 Objektklassen unterteilt haben wir die Bilder mit dem hchsten Anteil der relevanten Klassen extrahiert und diese den Straen zugeordnet Auf der Karte in Abbildung 2 knnen somit Straen mit hoher Vegetation oder hoher Parkraumdichte identifiziert werden Es ist interessant dass viele Straen einen hohen Anteil an Himmel haben Dies kann an breiten Straen und groen Freiflchen wie vor der Pinakothek liegen oder einfach daran dass die meisten Kameras in den Himmel gerichtet waren Automatisierungsalgorithmus Wir wollen jedoch nicht nur einen Stadtteil analysieren sondern im besten Fall ganz Mnchen und noch weitere Stdte in denen GOAT derzeit eingesetzt wirdreferences Unsere erste Herausforderung bestand darin die API fr grere Gebiete abzurufen Hierzu haben wir eine Funktion entwickelt mit der das gewnschte Gebiet in ein Raster kleinerer Quadrate unterteilt wird Um den Server nicht zu berlasten haben wir eine kurze Zeitpause zwischen der Abfrage der einzelnen Quadrate eingefgt Nach erfolgreicher Abfrage aller Quadrate werden die extrahierten Informationen in einer JSONDatei zusammengefhrt Die zweite Herausforderung bezog sich auf die Parameter fr die API Je nach bentigten Daten erfordert die API einen anderen Satz von Parametern der manuell festgelegt werden muss Um dies zu lsen haben wir unsere eigene Objektbibliothek aus der vollstndigen Liste der Objekte der Mapillary APIDokumentationhttpswwwmapillarycomdeveloperapidocumentation httpswwwmapillarycomdeveloperapidocumentation zusammengestellt Diese individualisierte Bibliothek befindet sich in einer YAMLDatei und enthlt alle fr die API erforderlichen Parameter Somit kann das Skript in einem einzigen Durchlauf mehrere Objekte entweder ber die Object Detection API oder die Map Features API abrufen Alle hierzu entwickelten Skripte sind in unserem GitHubRepohttpsgithubcomgoatcommunitymapillaryapi httpsgithubcomgoatcommunitymapillaryapi zu finden Nutzung der Daten Und wie nutzen wir diese Informationen Zur Analyse der Erreichbarkeit und Beurteilung des Gehkomforts Aktuell haben wir die Daten aus Mapillary genutzt um eine bessere Datengrundlage fr den Walkability Indexposts20210406walkabilityindex zu erlangen und in diesem Zuge ber 10000 Bilder in der Stadt Freiburg erfasst Doch es gibt auch noch viele weitere Einsatzmglichkeiten Nehmen wir an wir analysieren die empfundene fulufige Erreichbarkeit in einer Nachbarschaft bei Nacht Hierfr interessieren uns Faktoren die die Attraktivitt des Zufugehens beeinflussen In diesem Fall wre dies va die Beleuchtung Diese Informationen reprsentiert durch das Vorhandensein von Straenlaternen knnen wir durch die Mapillary API abrufen und somit die Genauigkeit der Analysen verbessern Ein anderer Anwendungsfall knnte die Analyse des Parkangebots in einer Stadt sein Mit der Objekterkennungsfunktion ist es mglich parkende Autos am Straenrand zu identifizieren Straenabschnitte mit einem besonders hohen Anteil an Parkflche knnen somit aufgezeigt und zu lebenswerteren Rumen umgestaltet werden"},{"title":"Innovationswettbewerb der Stadt

Attraktivitt fr Fugnger bercksichtigt Die Idee zur Entwicklung von WALKIE sowie ein erster Prototyp entstanden im Rahmen des MobiDataBW Hackathons im November 2020 Das Team nutzte die darauffolgende Innovationsphase MrzJuni 2021 zur Weiterentwicklung und Verstetigung der Funktionen mit der Stadt Freiburg als Pilotstandort WALKIE ist nun ein aussagekrftiger multikriterieller Walkability Index der die Attraktivitt des Zufugehens quantitativ abbildet Zunchst wurden auf Basis bestehender wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse die Qualittskriterien der Walkability sowie deren Gewichtungen ermittelt Als Resultat wurde der Walkability Index mit sechs Kategorien die in 22 SubIndikatoren unterteilt sind entwickelt Die WalkabilityKategorien Gehkomfort Schutz vor dem Straenverkehr Beleuchtung subjektive Sicherheit Belebtheit Gehumgebung Vegetation Gewsser Urbane Ausstattung Die zahlreichen Einzelindikatoren wurden in einem Algorithmus bewertet gewichtet und zu einem GesamtWalkabilityScore aggregiert Dabei wurden Scores zwischen 0 und 100 errechnet wobei 0 eine niedrige und 100 eine hohe Fugngerfreundlichkeit bedeuten Wir haben unterschiedliche Datenquellen benutzt Zum einen durch Crowdsorcing erhobene Datenstze aber auch die OpenDataPlattformen von Stadt und Land zB FreiGIShttpsgeoportalfreiburgdefreigis Darber hinaus haben wir fr die Stadt Freiburg ber 10000 Bildaufnahmen des Straenraums
